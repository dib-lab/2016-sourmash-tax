Goals: 

To do:
- Address some questions posed by Titus and develop some more 
	- What benchmarks do we need to run? 
		- Metapallete foes this based on some kraken stuff. Can we pick this up and run it with our own stuff? What kinds of data sets do we need to have ready? What kinds of comparisons do we need to run? 
		
The process: 

- [ ] Make sourmash and khmer docker containers 
	- Include directions using 
	- Not sure in sbt branch is included in git clone but should be easy to figure out
- [ ] Make outline of major steps 
- [ ] Review sourmash stuff on Github 
	- https://github.com/dib-lab/2016-sourmash-tax/blob/master/README.md
- [ ] Build signatures for genomes of interest 
-  [ ] Build an SBT and search 
- [ ] Use Hu 2016 (I.e. Banfield) data set for comparisons
	- Specifically, Titus said " once we have abundance weighted minhash for metagenomes implemented, Iâ€™m betting we can do sample ordination as well (i.e. cluster and find related samples, taking into account abundance). I bet the Hu data set from the Banfield lab that we used in the SIO workshop will be a good test comparison here (and might also  work for the above)."
